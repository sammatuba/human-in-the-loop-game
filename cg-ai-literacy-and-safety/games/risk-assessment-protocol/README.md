# Risk Assessment Protocol

Assess AI systems through the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply the four NIST AI RMF functions: MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE, GOVERN
- Classify AI systems using EU AI Act risk tiers (Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal)
- Identify key stakeholders in AI governance and their concerns
- Understand mitigation strategies for AI risks across different domains

## Gameplay

1. **System Briefing** — An AI system card is dealt and revealed with risk tier badge
2. **MAP** — Identify the key risks associated with the system
3. **MEASURE** — Select appropriate assessment tools and metrics
4. **MANAGE** — Choose mitigation strategies from a hand of option cards
5. **GOVERN** — Select stakeholders from a meeting table layout
6. **Results** — See consequences of your assessment decisions

## Framework Alignment

- **NIST AI RMF**: MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE, GOVERN — core framework of the game
- **EU AI Act**: Risk tier classification, compliance requirements
- **OECD AI Principles**: Accountability, robustness/safety, transparency
