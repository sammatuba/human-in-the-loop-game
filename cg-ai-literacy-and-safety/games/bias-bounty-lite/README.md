# Bias Bounty

Investigate AI systems and identify patterns of algorithmic bias.

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize three patterns of AI bias: Bad Start (biased training data), Wrong Measuring (flawed metrics), and Sneaky Shortcuts (proxy discrimination)
- Understand real-world impacts of algorithmic bias across employment, finance, healthcare, criminal justice, and social media
- Apply critical thinking to identify how unfairness enters automated decision-making

## Gameplay

1. **Reveal System** — An AI system card is dealt face-down, then flipped to reveal
2. **Reveal Problems** — Three problem cards are dealt showing issues with the system
3. **Observe** — Silent study period with timer
4. **Discuss & Vote** — Match each problem to one of the three bias patterns
5. **Commit** — Lock in your answers
6. **Reflect** — Review results, see real-world impacts and framework alignments
