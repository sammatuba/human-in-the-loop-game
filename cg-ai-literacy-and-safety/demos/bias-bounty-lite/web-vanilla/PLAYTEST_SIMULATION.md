## Replayability Analysis

### Factors Supporting Replayability

1. **Pattern Recognition Skill Growth**
   - First play: Learning patterns (60-70% accuracy)
   - Second play: Applying patterns (80-90% accuracy)
   - Third play+: Mastery pursuit (95-100% accuracy)

2. **Score Progression System**
   - Clear metrics: Points, accuracy percentage
   - Rating tiers: Encourages improvement
   - Perfect score challenge

3. **Content Depth**

### Replayability Score: 7.5/10

**Strengths:**
- Clear progression metrics
- Educational value persists
- Different experiences (solo/group)
- Perfect score challenge

**Limitations:**
- Fixed problem set (24 cards)
- Patterns become predictable after 2-3 plays
- No randomization of content
