## 6. Comparative Analysis

### 6.1 Comparison with Human-in-the-Loop

| Feature | Risk Assessment Protocol | Human-in-the-Loop | Gap |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Scenarios | 6 systems | 15 scenarios | -9 |
| Frameworks | NIST, EU AI Act | UNESCO, OECD, NIST, EU, CoE | Less coverage |
| Consequences | Score only | Rich story outcomes | Missing depth |
| Difficulty Levels | None | Adaptive (3 levels) | Missing |
| Randomization | Static | Random selection | No replayability |
| Concepts | 6 taught | 9 taught | Less depth |
| Quizzes | None | Post-scenario | No verification |

### 6.2 Unique Value Proposition

**"Risk Assessment Framework Training"** - Unlike Human-in-the-Loop's focus on decision-making, Risk Assessment Protocol teaches the **structured methodology** of AI risk management using NIST RMF and EU AI Act frameworks.
