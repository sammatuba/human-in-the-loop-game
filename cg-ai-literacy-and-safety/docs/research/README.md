## Quick Navigation

| Stage | Folder | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Research** | `01-foundations/` | UNESCO, OECD, NIST, EU frameworks; gamification pedagogy |
| **Exploration** | `02-brainstorming/` | 14 game concepts, evaluation matrix, strategic recommendations |
| **Simulation** | `03-game-designs/` | Detailed walkthrough of Bias Bounty mechanics |
| **Refinement** | `04-simplification/` | Frameworks for making games accessible to general audiences |
| **Production** | `05-final-designs/` | **FINAL: Complete Bias Bounty Lite specification** |

## Current Status

- ✅ Research complete (foundations documented)
- ✅ Brainstorming complete (concepts evaluated)
- ✅ Initial simulation complete (Bias Bounty detailed)
- ✅ Simplification frameworks established
- ✅ **Final design complete (Bias Bounty Lite ready for production)**

## Project Summary

### Selected Game: Bias Bounty Lite

**Tagline:** *Find the hidden unfairness—before it finds you.*

**Core Innovation:** Three intuitive patterns replace technical bias terminology:
- 🔴 **BAD START** - Learned from biased history
- 🟡 **WRONG MEASURING** - Measures success poorly  
- 🟢 **SNEAKY SHORTCUTS** - Finds hidden ways to discriminate

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Collaborative, not competitive** - Group investigates together
2. **No hidden information** - All cards visible, no memory burden
3. **Warm-up first** - Non-AI examples teach pattern recognition
4. **Human impact focus** - Every problem shows WHO was affected
5. **Standards-backed** - Aligns with UNESCO, OECD, NIST, EU frameworks

### Game Specs
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Players | 3-6 (best: 4-5) |
| Time | 25-35 minutes |
| Age | 12+ |
| Components | 40 cards + rulebook |
| Complexity | Light-medium |

### What's in the Final Design Document

The complete production specification includes:
- **8 System cards** (Hiring, Loan, Health, School, Crime, Insurance, Content, Voice)
- **24 Problem cards** (3 per system, real-world examples)
- **3 Type reference cards** (BAD START, WRONG MEASURING, SNEAKY SHORTCUTS)
- **3 Warm-up cards** (Non-AI examples for teaching patterns)
- Complete rules and facilitation guide
- Accessibility features
- Production specifications
- Expansion roadmap

## Next Steps (If Proceeding)

1. **Playtest** the 40-card set with target audiences
2. **Refine** card text based on comprehension testing
3. **Design** visual layout and iconography
4. **Produce** prototype for testing
5. **Iterate** based on feedback
