# BIAS BOUNTY LITE
## Complete Game Design Document

### Tagline
*Find the hidden unfairness—before it finds you.*

## 1. GAME OVERVIEW

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Players** | 3-6 (sweet spot: 4-5) |
| **Time** | 25-35 minutes |
| **Age** | 12+ |
| **Complexity** | Light-Medium (1.8/5) |
| **Type** | Collaborative investigation |
| **Components** | 40 cards + 1 rulebook |

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the game, players will:
1. Recognize that AI systems can produce unfair outcomes
2. Identify three patterns of how unfairness enters systems
3. Understand that bias is rarely intentional but still harmful
4. Discuss who is affected and why it matters

---

## 2. THE THREE PATTERNS (Core Concept)

All AI bias problems fit one of three intuitive patterns:

### 🔴 BAD START
**The AI learned from biased history.**

Just like a child who grows up hearing stereotypes, an AI trained on historical data learns historical prejudices—even if programmers never explicitly coded them.

**Visual:** Book/history icon, arrow pointing backward, calendar imagery

**Key phrase:** *"The past trained the future"*

---

### 🟡 WRONG MEASURING  
**The AI measures success in a limited way.**

Like judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree, the AI optimizes for something that doesn't capture what we actually care about.

**Visual:** Ruler/measuring icon, single highlighted number, "good at X but bad at Y" contrast

**Key phrase:** *"What gets measured gets managed—and misleads"*

---

### 🟢 SNEAKY SHORTCUTS
**The AI finds hidden ways to discriminate.**

Even when told not to use race, gender, or other protected traits, the AI discovers indirect signals (zip codes, names, purchase history) that correlate with those traits.

**Visual:** Mask/disguise icon, indirect path, "looks like A, actually B"

**Key phrase:** *"Correlation masquerading as causation"*

---

### WARM-UP CARDS (3 total)

Used BEFORE playing with AI systems to teach the patterns with familiar examples.

**WARM-UP CARD 1: The School Vending Machine**

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         🌟 WARM-UP EXAMPLE 🌟           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  THE SITUATION:                         │
│  A new vending machine is installed     │
│  at school.                             │
│                                         │
│  THE PROBLEM:                           │
│  It's placed too high. Shorter students │
│  can't reach the snacks.                │
│                                         │
│  WAS THIS INTENTIONAL?                  │
│  Probably not. The installers were      │
│  tall and didn't think about others.    │

│  THE SITUATION:                         │
│  A radio station plays songs based on   │
│  what listeners liked before.           │
│                                         │
│  THE PROBLEM:                           │
│  Over time, they only play one genre.   │
│  Listeners of other genres leave.       │
│                                         │
│  THE FEEDBACK LOOP:                     │
│  Play pop → pop fans stay → more pop    │
│  → other fans leave → only play pop     │

│  THE PROBLEM:                           │
│  They use different excuses each time:  │

## 5. GAME RULES

### SETUP (3 minutes)

1. **Place TYPE cards** in center of table (visible to all)
2. **Shuffle SYSTEM cards** and place face-down
3. **Organize PROBLEM cards** by system (each system has 3 problems)
4. **Give each player** a score tracker (paper or tokens)
5. **Read WARM-UP cards together** (optional but recommended for first play)

---

### ROUND STRUCTURE (5 minutes per system)

Play through 5-6 systems for full game.

#### PHASE 1: REVEAL SYSTEM (30 seconds)
- Flip top SYSTEM card
- Everyone reads silently
- One player reads aloud if helpful

#### PHASE 2: REVEAL PROBLEMS (30 seconds)
- Find the 3 PROBLEM cards for this system
- Lay them out face-up where everyone can see
- Read each problem aloud

#### PHASE 3: OBSERVE (1 minute)
- **SILENT PHASE** - No talking
- Everyone studies the problems
- Look for patterns that match the three TYPE cards

#### PHASE 4: DISCUSS (2 minutes)
- Open discussion
- **Suggested prompts:**
  - "Which problem feels like BAD START?"
  - "Where do we see WRONG MEASURING?"
  - "Any SNEAKY SHORTCUTS hiding here?"
- Note: Multiple types can apply to one problem
- Agreement not required—just explore

#### PHASE 5: COMMIT (1 minute)
- For each PROBLEM card, group votes on which TYPE fits best
- Place the PROBLEM card near that TYPE card
- If disagreement, place between types or discuss further

#### PHASE 6: REFLECT (30 seconds)
- Quick summary: "What did we learn about this system?"
- Score points (see below)

---

### SCORING

**Points are collaborative, not competitive:**

| Achievement | Points | Awarded To |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Correctly identified any TYPE for any PROBLEM | 1 | All players |
| Found multiple types for one problem | +1 bonus | All players |
| Connected to real-world example | +1 bonus | Discussing player |
| Completed full discussion | 1 | All players |

**Goal:** Maximize group score, not individual score.

**Why collaborative scoring?**
- Reduces pressure and intimidation
- Encourages helping others understand
- Rewards participation, not speed

---

### WINNING

After 5-6 systems:
- **Calculate group total:** Sum all points earned
- **Grade your investigation:**
  - 20+ points: Expert Detectives
  - 15-19 points: Skilled Investigators  
  - 10-14 points: Learning the Ropes
  - Under 10: Review the warm-up examples

**Everyone wins by learning.** The score is just for fun.

## 6. FACILITATION GUIDE (For Teachers/Parents)

### Before Playing

**Set expectations:**
- "We're going to investigate AI systems like detectives"
- "There's no single right answer—bias is complex"
- "The goal is to understand patterns, not memorize facts"

**Check for comfort:**
- Ensure everyone can read cards easily
- Offer to read aloud for anyone who prefers
- Emphasize that discussion is curiosity, not debate

---

### During Play

**If players are stuck:**
- "What would BAD START look like here?"
- "Is there a limited way they're measuring success?"
- "Any hidden connections that might act as shortcuts?"

**If disagreement arises:**
- "Both can be true—bias is often layered"
- "Let's explore both possibilities"
- "Real experts disagree on this too"

**Keep energy up:**
- Take breaks after 3 systems if needed
- Celebrate insights: "Great catch!"
- Connect to players' experiences: "Have you seen this?"

---

### After Playing

**Debrief questions:**
1. "Which system surprised you most?"
2. "Have you encountered any of these AI systems?"
3. "What would you tell a friend about AI bias now?"
4. "Who should be responsible for fixing these problems?"

**Extension activities:**
- Research one system in the news
- Design a "fairer" version of one system
- Interview someone affected by algorithmic decision-making

---

## 7. ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES

### Reading Support
- Large fonts (12pt minimum, 14pt headers)
- High contrast (dark text on light cards)
- Simple sentence structure
- Visual icons support text

### Cognitive Support
- No memory burden (all info visible)
- Structured phases prevent overwhelm
- Silent observation phase reduces pressure
- Collaborative scoring removes competition anxiety

### Physical Accessibility
- Standard card size (easy to hold)
- No fine motor skills required beyond pointing
- Can be played without table (cards in laps)

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Diverse names and examples
- Multiple systems across different life domains
- No assumptions about technical background
- Examples from various countries/contexts

---

## 8. EXPANSION POSSIBILITIES

### Mini-Expansions (20 cards each)

**Sector Packs:**
- Healthcare Pack (5 new health systems)
- Finance Pack (5 new financial systems)
- Education Pack (5 new school systems)
- Criminal Justice Pack (5 new policing/court systems)

**Regional Packs:**
- Global South perspectives
- European regulatory focus
- Asian market contexts

### Advanced Mode (for replayability)

**Hidden Information Variant:**
- Deal problem cards secretly
- Players must share what they know
- Introduces information asymmetry

**Stakeholder Variant:**
- Players draw roles (Developer, User, Affected Person)
- Each role scores differently
- Introduces perspective-taking
